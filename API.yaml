  description: The App can be partially customised through the Configuration Settings
    downloaded at the App startup and updated every time the App starts a session,
    whether in the foreground or background. For example, these include information
    such as the weights to be used by the Mobile Client in the calculation of the
    Total Risk Score.
- name: OTP
  description: The OTP Service provides an API to the National Healthcare Service
    for authorising OTPs that can be used to upload data from the Mobile Client via
    the Exposure Ingestion Service. The OTP is generated by the App and communicated
    by the user to the Healthcare Operator (e.g., during a phone call). The Healthcare
    Operator inserts the OTP into the HIS, which then registers the OTP on the OTP
    Service. The OTP automatically expires after a defined interval. If the data have
    not been uploaded by the time the OTP expires, the user will have to restart the
    process with a new OTP.
- name: Exposure Ingestion
  description: The Exposure Ingestion Service provides an API for the Mobile Client
    to upload its TEKs for the previous 14 days, in the case that the user tests positive
    for SARS-CoV-2 and decides to share them. Contextually, the Mobile Client uploads
    the Epidemiological Infos from the previous 14 days, if any. If some Epidemiological
    Infos are indeed uploaded, the user's Province of Domicile is uploaded too. The
    upload can only take place with an authorised OTP. The Exposure Ingestion Service
    is also responsible for periodically generating the TEK Chunks to be published
    by the Exposure Reporting Service. The TEK Chunks are assigned a unique incremental
    index and are immutable. They are generated periodically as the Mobile Clients
    upload new TEKs. TEK Chunks older than 14 days are automatically deleted from
    the database by an async cleanup job. Province of Domicile and Epidemiological
    Infos are forwarded to the Analytics Service.
- name: Exposure Reporting
  description: The Exposure Reporting Service makes the TEK Chunks created by the
    Exposure Ingestion Service available to the Mobile Client. Only TEK Chunks for
    the last 14 days are made available. To avoid downloading the same TEKs multiple
    times, the Mobile Clients fetch the indexes of the TEK Chunks available to download
    first. Then, they only actually download TEK Chunks with indexes for which TEK
    Chunks have not been downloaded before.
