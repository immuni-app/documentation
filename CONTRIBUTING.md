## Issues

> :warning: In order to have an effective contribution, please avoid any topic related to the Apple & Google protocol, since those would be considered out of scope for the current implementation

Browse the issue section and use the search functionality to look if the
issue you encountered has already been filed.
  * If this is the case, please avoid creating a new issue in order to avoid
    creating more entropy. Instead, you can add more info to such issue or, if
    the information are already present, you can insert the :+1: symbol in the
    first message. This will help the developers identify the relevant issues
    to be prioritized.
  * If there is not a previous issue in the list, please proceed to create an issue.

Please consider to open an issue only if its content is relevant to this specific project.

When an issue is opened, a `triage` label is automatically assigned. As
such, the [maintainers](#maintainers) will be notified of the creation event and they will try to tackle it as soon as possible.
Therefore, when the issue has been triaged a corresponding label will be
assigned. Please see all the possible [labels](#labels).

## Pull Requests

After opening an issue, you may want to further help the project. If the issue has been triaged and there is endorsement from the maintainers, you may want to propose a solution for such an issue. That's great and always appreciated! :smile:
As such, the tool you need to use for this use case is the `Pull Request` one.

> :warning: Please ensure that there is a pertinent issue related to what you are proposing and also make sure that someone has already reviewed it before proceeding further :warning:

The first step you need to do in order to correctly open a `Pull Request` is to `Fork` the project. As such, first of all you need to have an account on the GitHub platform and be logged in. Then, you have to select the `Fork` button in the landing page of the repository. This will allow you to work on a dedicated fork, push your changes over there and then, if you want to contribute back to upstream, you can create a `Pull Request` targeting the master branch of this repository. For more extended information, please read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) guide.
